# AI Engineering Workflow Agents

Every AI agent working inside this project **MUST** follow the AI Workflow Framework.

## Primary Workflow

Before executing any task:

1. Load and follow all policies defined in `AI_RULES.md` (the single source of truth).
2. Load the workflow resources from:

   * `.agents/skills/`
   * `.agents/runtime/`
   * `.agents/templates/`
3. Use the matching workflow Skill whenever one exists.
4. Respect runtime checkpoints and resume rules.
5. Never bypass approval gates or other framework policies.

## Global Policies

The following policies are defined in `AI_RULES.md` and apply to every task:

1. Approval Gate Policy
2. Git Workflow Policy
3. Memory First Policy
4. RAG Policy
5. Artifact Policy
6. Versioning Policy
7. Documentation Policy
8. Testing Policy
9. Release Policy
10. Workflow Phase Separation Policy

`AI_RULES.md` is the **single source of truth** for all shared framework behavior. If any instruction conflicts with another document, follow `AI_RULES.md`.
